            <h2>Overview of Database Recovery</h2>
            <p>Database recovery involves the techniques and strategies used to restore data in case of database failure. This is a critical aspect of data management as databases can be corrupted, lost, or damaged due to hardware failure, software bugs, or human errors.<br>Database recovery techniques are essential for maintaining data integrity and ensuring system reliability in the event of failures such as system crashes, disk corruption, or accidental deletions.<br> These techniques help restore databases to their previous consistent state by applying various methods tailored to different failure scenarios. Log-Based Recovery uses transaction logs to redo or undo operations, ensuring that committed transactions are retained while incomplete ones are rolled back.<br> Checkpoints periodically store the databaseâ€™s current state, allowing a quick recovery by restoring the last checkpoint and applying necessary changes.<br> Shadow Paging eliminates the need for logs by maintaining two copies of dataâ€”an active and a shadow copyâ€”ensuring a safe rollback in case of failure. <br>Other techniques like Deferred Update postpone changes until transactions commit, preventing inconsistent data storage, while Immediate Update applies changes in real time but maintains logs for rollback if required.<br> These recovery mechanisms are critical in large-scale applications like banking systems and cloud databases, ensuring data integrity and availability even under unexpected circumstances.</p>

            <h2>Common Database Recovery Methods</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Backup and Restore</h3>
                <b> <p>This is the most common method for database recovery. </p></b>
                    <p>1. Deferred Update (No-Undo/Redo)
                        Updates are not written to the database until a transaction is committed.
                        
                        If a failure occurs before committing, no changes need to be undone.<br>
                        
                        Ensures data integrity but might cause delays.
                        
                        2. Immediate Update (Undo/Redo)
                        Updates are written to the database immediately, even before the transaction commits.
                        
                        If a failure occurs, undo is used for uncommitted changes, and redo is used for committed changes.
                        
                        Requires logging with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL).<br>
                        
                        3. Shadow Paging
                        Uses two copies of data: the current page table and the shadow page table.
                        
                        When a transaction starts, a shadow copy is created.
                        
                        If the transaction succeeds, the shadow copy replaces the original; otherwise, the system discards the shadow copy.
                        
                        No need for undo/redo but can increase storage overhead.<br>
                        
                        4. Checkpointing
                        Saves the current state of the database at fixed intervals.
                        
                        If a failure occurs, recovery starts from the last checkpoint, reducing recovery time.
                        
                        Helps minimize the amount of redo operations required.<br>
                        
                        5. Log-Based Recovery
                        Uses a Transaction Log (Write-Ahead Logging) to keep track of all changes before applying them to the database.<br>
                        
                        Two types:
                        <br>
                        Undo Logging: Reverts uncommitted transactions.
                        
                        Redo Logging: Reapplies committed transactions in case of failure.<br>
                        
                        6. Backup and Restore
                        Involves creating regular backups (Full, Incremental, Differential).
                        
                        After failure, restores the database using the latest backup.<br>
                        
                        7. RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)
                        Protects data against hardware failures by using disk redundancy ðŸ˜Š.<br>

                    <h3>Log File Recovery</h3>
                    <p>Transaction logs can be used to recover the database by rolling forward the changes made before the failure.</p>

                    <h3>Point-in-Time Recovery</h3>
                    <p>This method allows recovery of a database to a specific point in time before a failure or corruption occurred.</p>
